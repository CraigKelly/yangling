Help for wrangling the yelp academic dataset

Important: this is a pretty hacky collection of scripts used for some *very*
specific research purposes. They might be helpful, but you probably don't
want to treat these as a general solution for anything :)

## Using

Just running `make` should be sufficient. The scripts assume that you've
extracted the yelp academic dataset to this directory.

## Dependencies

* make
* Python 3
* unidecode

You can install unidecode locallly: `pip3 install --user unidecode`
